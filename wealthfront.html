            <p>The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax liability of the client will
                depend on the client's entire tax and
                investment profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client's (or client's spouse's) accounts
                outside of Wealthfront Advisers and
                type of investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax
                loss harvesting may generate a higher
                number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a chance that trading attributed to tax
                loss harvesting may create capital gains
                and wash sales and could be subject to higher transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax
                loss harvesting strategies may produce
                losses, which may not be offset by sufficient gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000
                deduction against income. The utilization
                of losses harvested through the strategy will depend upon the recognition of capital gains in the same
                or a future tax period, and in addition
                may be subject to limitations under applicable tax laws, e.g., if there are insufficient realized gains
                in the tax period, the use of harvested
                losses may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income and distributions. Losses harvested through
                the strategy that are not utilized in the
                tax period when recognized (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant capital loss
                carryforwards), generally may be carried
                forward to offset future capital gains, if any.</p>
            <p>All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of money you invest, and past performance does
